# Quantum-Tomography-experiment
This github repository contains codes ussed for the analysis of the measurements, and proccessed results from the experiment. 
The videos that were taken during the experiment are not here because they are too large for a git repository.   

This repository contains:

- Codes_for_the_Graphs folder, which contains the two matlab codes that we used to draw all the graphs in the paper.
- Graphs folder, which contains all the graph that we made + some data used for the graphs. The graphs are divided into different parts of the experiment, and the parts of the computer simulation. The simulation parts contains the simulation's code.  
- random_binary_string file, which generates a randon binary string of a given length. This code was used for the random strings needed for the experiment.
- CITATION.cff file, used for citing this repository in our paper, and potentially other papers.
